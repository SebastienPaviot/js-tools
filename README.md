# Tools Repository

Welcome to the **tools** repository, a collection of useful scripts designed to assist and accelerate my development research. This repository currently contains a script that analyzes the characteristics of devices (smartphones, tablets, or desktops).

## MediaDevices List

This script provides a detailed list of media devices (such as cameras, microphones, and speakers) available on your device. It utilizes the `navigator.mediaDevices.enumerateDevices()` method to fetch and display information about the connected media devices.
